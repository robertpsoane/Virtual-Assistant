# Virtual-Assistant
You'll need "VA.py" and "Aps.txt" downloaded to the same folder for this to work.

Commands so far are "Hello", "Who are you?", "What's the time?", "Make an appointment", and "Goodbye", which ends the program

Thanks https://dev.to/vinayveerappaji/create-your-own-simple-virtual-assistant-1kfp for the jumping off point
